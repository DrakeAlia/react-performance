// to make this code split, we added a React.lazy right here instead of a direct import for that globe module. 
// As a reminder, that globe module has a default export that is a component.

// It's really important that the default export is a component because that's how React knows what to render when 
// this lazily loaded code is finally loaded. It will only render the default export of the module that we're importing.

// With that in hand, we can now come down here and render that just like it's a regular component. 
// If it had props, we could pass those props just like normal. It would behave, for all intents and purposes, 
// as a regular globe container.

// We put a Suspense boundary around this to specify a fallback UI for what we should show while the user's waiting 
// for that code to load. We're able to lazily load the code for this globe so that users don't have to wait 
// for that entire globe to show up before they can start interacting with our app.
